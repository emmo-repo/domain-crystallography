Crystallography Domain Ontology
===============================
A crystallography domain ontology based on [EMMO][1] and the [CIF core][2] dictionary.
It is implemented as a formal language.


Status
------
- [ ] Proposal
- [X] accepted, under development
- [ ] official

This domain ontology is work-in-progress (WIP), it is in the process
of being accepted as a task group by the EMMC.

* Application submitted: 15 June 2020
* Application accepted on: TBD


Imported Ontologies
-------------------
This ontology builds on top of EMMO. See the following table for version
compatibilies:

| Imported Ontologies | Version           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| [EMMO][1]           | 1.0.0-beta        |
| [CIF-ontology][2]   | 0.1.0             |



Obtaining the Crystallography Domain Ontology
---------------------------------------------
The Crystallography Domain Ontology can be access or opened in Protege
using the following url

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emmo-repo/domain-crystallography/master/crystallography.ttl

It can also be cloned from its [GitHub repository][3].  With [ssh
access to GitHub][github-ssh] set up, the Crystallography Domain
Ontology can be cloned with

    git clone git@github.com:emmo-repo/domain-crystallography.git

In EMMO-python correct import is obatined with

```python
from emmo import get_ontology

# Loading crystallography from local repository
cryst = get_ontology('/path/to/crystallography.ttl').load()

# Loading crystallography from web
cryst = get_ontology('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emmo-repo/domain-crystallography/master/crystallography.ttl').load()
```
