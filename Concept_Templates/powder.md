Describes a database for identifying compounds based on matching observed peak positions.

### Comments

Powders are more complex than single crystals, in that they are in general mixtures of one or more compounds, some of which may be amorphous
(non-crystalline)
and some of which might not be identified and simply labelled impurities. In some situations no crystal structure modelling is performed, and
the observed peaks are simply matched to a database of known compounds for compound identification. While the IUCr definition encompasses solid
polycrystalline blocks, these are potentially better considered as a separate concept given EMMO's clear distinction between solids and mixtures.

While a typical powder diffraction pattern obtained from a powder will contain peaks, it is impossible to further describe the appearance of these peaks:
they might be quite broad due to small particle sizes, or purely amorphous components, they may be extremely narrow, their shapes can be asymmetric
or symmetric and so on. Therefore, unlike a single crystal, a powder is not distinguished by having particular crystallographic properties and so
is simply described based on physical appearance.

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation

A material consisting of a large number of grains. These grains are composed of one or more compounds in solid form forming distinct
homogeneous domains. Compounds within the grain that have a crystalline structure are called crystallites.

### Preferred label
"powder"
### Alternate labels

### Discussion:

The object of this concept is to capture all known data linked to powder diffraction experiments. Restricting a search to powder samples
will therefore not reject samples containing amorphous components or samples for which a structure has not been determined. In general even an amorphous 
powder will produce a diffractogram with some structure from which structural information can be derived. Thus the definition is quite general and
encompasses the general wikipedia meaning while excluding the polycrystalline solid block. It is possible that the EMMO already has a concept
that aligns sufficiently with this to make this concept redundant.

Engineered nanoparticles with distinct shell and core regions composed of different materials (or the same material with a different structure) 
also fall under this definition.

It is not clear whether it is too restrictive to require distinct domains within the grains. Some powder particles may contain gradations of
crystallinity with depth due to surface treatments or stresses.
