Describes a database for identifying compounds based on matching observed peak positions.

### Comments

Powders are more complex than single crystals, in that they are in general mixtures of one or more compounds, some of which may be amorphous
(non-crystalline)
and some of which might not be identified and simply labelled impurities. In some situations no crystal structure modelling is performed, and
the observed peaks are simply matched to a database of known compounds for compound identification. While the IUCr definition encompasses solid
polycrystalline blocks, these are potentially better considered as a separate concept given EMMO's clear distinction between solids and mixtures.

While a typical powder diffraction pattern obtained from a powder will contain peaks, it is impossible to further describe the appearance of these peaks:
they might be quite broad due to small particle sizes, or purely amorphous components, they may be extremely narrow, their shapes can be asymmetric
or symmetric and so on. Therefore, unlike a single crystal, a powder is not distinguished by having particular crystallographic properties and so
can only be described based on physical appearance.

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation

A material consisting of a large number of distinct grains. The material is freely-flowing, that is, the grains are not amalgamated 
into a single solid object.

### Preferred label
"powder"
### Alternate labels

### Discussion:

The object of this concept is to capture all known data linked to powder diffraction experiments. Restricting a search to powder samples
should therefore not reject samples containing amorphous components or samples for which a structure has not been determined. In general even an amorphous 
powder (e.g. from ground glass) will produce a diffractogram with some structure from which structural information can be derived. 
Thus the definition is quite general and encompasses the general wikipedia meaning while excluding the polycrystalline solid block.
It is possible that the EMMO already has a concept that aligns sufficiently with this to make defining a separate "powder" concept redundant.

No mention has been made of common attributes ascribed by crystallographers to powders, such as grain size, texture, core-shell distinctions within
a single grain, microstrain and so on. These can be created a separate concepts as part of models that are used to describe data obtained
from powder samples.
