Expert discussions also raised the issue of different dimensionality crystals, quasicrystals and so on.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal: information as above, as well as history of the term, some 
discussion of various types of crystal including quasicrystals and crystal defects.

### Comments

The vast majority of crystal structures have been determined by modelling samples as arrangements 
of atoms that are periodic in 3 
dimensions (400,000 according to Wikipedia reference 20). Therefore it is important that this very
common model is captured by our concept definition.

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
A mathematical model that includes a space-filling infinite array of non-overlapping repeating volume units, where each
volume unit contains an arrangement of atoms that is, on average, identical. The volume unit is called a "unit cell". The
model predicts the location and intensity of diffraction peaks scattered by a material.
### Preferred label
"conventional crystal structure model"
### Alternate labels
 "crystal", "three-dimensional crystal", "periodic crystal"
### Discussion:
The vast majority (>99.99%) of machine-readable crystal structures have been determined based on this model, therefore it should have a place in the ontology.
Note that "space-filling" is an important restriction, as other modelling approaches allow overlapping repeated volumes, or for voids
to appear between the repeating units.

EMMO does not allow abstract concepts, such as "model". Instead, a semiotic process should be described involving mathematical expressions, data,
and interpreters that link the mathematical expressions to data. This involves the "semiotic" EMMO ontology in the Holistic perspective, as well
as the "Data" perspective.
