Expert discussions also raised the issue of different dimensionality crystals, quasicrystals and so on.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal: information as above, as well as history of the term, some 
discussion of various types of crystal including quasicrystals and crystal defects.

### Comments

The vast majority of crystal structures are formed of arrangements of atoms that are periodic in 3 
dimensions (400,000 according to Wikipedia reference 20). Therefore it is important that this very
common model is captured by our concept definition.

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
A model consisting of a space-filling infinite array of repeating volume units, where each
volume unit contains an identical arrangement of atoms. The volume unit is called a "unit cell".
### Preferred label
"conventional crystal structure model"
### Alternate labels
 "crystal", "three-dimensional crystal", "periodic crystal"
### Discussion:
The vast majority (>99.99%) of machine-readable crystal structures have been determined based on this model, therefore it should have a place in the ontology.
