Expert discussions also raised the issue of different dimensionality crystals, quasicrystals and so on.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal: information as above, as well as history of the term,
some discussion of various types of crystal including quasicrystals and crystal defects.

### Comments

The vast majority of crystal structures are formed of arrangements of atoms that are
periodic in 3 dimensions (400,000 according to Wikipedia reference 20). Almost all
measurements on samples are modelled assuming the sample is a single crystal.

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
A sample of a solid substance that has been well-described by using a crystalline model
(see #5 ). No more than one crystalline model is required for modelling the measurements, so the sample is neither twinned nor a powder.
### Preferred label
"single crystal"
### Alternate labels
 "crystal", "three-dimensional crystal", "periodic crystal"
### Discussion
A material can only be known to be crystalline after measurements have been taken on it. 
For example, cut glass may appear the same as a naturally-occuring crystal, but is not crystalline.
The canonical measurement technique is to illuminate a sample of the material with beams of electrons,
X-rays, or neutrons, and if intensity is detected in specific directions the material is considered crystalline.
If the intensities and positions of all of the spots thus detected from a sample can be modelled
using a single crystalline model, the sample is considered to be a single crystal. A material would not
itself be considered a "single crystal", as various samples of notionally the same material might not all be single crystals.
