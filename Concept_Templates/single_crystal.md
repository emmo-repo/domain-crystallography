### Comments

The vast majority of crystal structures are formed of arrangements of atoms that are
periodic in 3 dimensions (400,000 according to Wikipedia reference 20). Almost all
measurements on samples are modelled assuming the sample is a single crystal.

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
A solid substance consisting of many repeated, non-overlapping volume units, called "unit cells".
### Preferred label
"single crystal"
### Alternate labels
 "crystal", "three-dimensional crystal", "periodic crystal"
### Discussion
A material can only be known to be crystalline after measurements have been taken on it. 
For example, cut glass may appear the same as a naturally-occuring crystal, but is not crystalline.
The canonical measurement technique is to illuminate a sample of the material with beams of electrons,
X-rays, or neutrons, and if intensity is detected in specific directions the material is considered crystalline.
A material would not itself be considered a "single crystal", as various samples of notionally the same material might not all be single crystals.
In order for this concept to be useful, other parts of EMMO need to state when a particular object can be interpreted as being a single crystal.

In the EMMO approach, a real object is considered to be an ideal crystal if data derived from a crystallographic model of an ideal crystal
is interpreted as applying to that object. If diffraction peaks are observed from a material, that would also be a basis for considering that
a material is crystalline, but it may have a more complex structure, such as being twinned or composite.
A separate concept is provided for such complex cases.
