## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
A sample is the most general concept for a specific representation of a material (in the EMMO sense) used in crystallographic experiments.

The concept of a sample requires that experiments have been conducted on the material, or are planned to be conducted.
If there are more than one distinct actor who performs or analyzes selections of experiments and/or apply their own 
interpretations to recorded experimental outcomes, they consider different representations of the same material, i.e., 
different samples. Multiple such samples of a material can exist in parallel with different relations to other 
crystallographic concepts. Furthermore, the material itself may undergo a physical transformation over time 
(which commonly happens as a side effect of the experiments conducted on it), i.e., the sample may have a sequence 
of temporal parts with different relations to crystallographic concepts.

The text above uses the word "experiment" to refer to a semiotic process that results in one or more signs related to the sample.

The concept "sample" may be generalizable outside the crystallography domain ontology to mean
a representation of a material used for any experiments (EMMO:sample?).
### Preferred label
"sample"
### Alternate labels
"crystallographic sample", "materials representation"
### Discussion:
Other crystallographic concepts related to "the thing that is being experimented on", e.g., "powder", should probably be
subclasses of sample.
