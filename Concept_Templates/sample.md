## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
A sample is a physical part of a material (in the EMMO sense) used in crystallographic experiments.
The physical entity that comprise the sample may change over time. 
Such change commonly happens as a side effect of the experiments conducted on it.

The concept of a sample requires that experiments have been conducted on the material, or are planned to be conducted.

The text above uses the word "experiment" to refer to a semiotic process that results in one or more signs related to the sample.

The concept "sample" may be generalizable outside the crystallography domain ontology to mean a representation of a material used for any experiments (EMMO:sample?).
### Preferred label
"sample"
### Alternate labels
"crystallographic sample", "materials representation"
### Discussion:
Other crystallographic concepts related to "the thing that is being experimented on", e.g., "powder", should probably be
subclasses of sample.
