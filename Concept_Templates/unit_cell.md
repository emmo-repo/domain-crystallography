### Comments

A unit cell is a repeating unit of atoms in a material that consists of some form of periodic repetition of atoms.
Depending on what type of crystalline material the material is, 
a unit cell may represent repreating units with some level of structutred non-periodicity by:
- Disordered occupation: designated atomic positions with statistical occupation representing repeating disorder.
- Assemblies: sets of atoms that represent multiple distinct alternative options for repeating disorder.  
- Attached atoms: atoms that are attached to a position without the precise location being known, e.g., the hydrogens of a methyl group, -CH3.

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
Data about the unit cell is represented in the CIF ontology by _cell_length_a, _cell_length_b, _cell_length_c, _cell_angle_alpha, _cell_angle_beta, _cell_angle_gamma,_cell_volume.
The concept is closely related to "crystal structure".
### Preferred label
Unit cell
### Alternate labels
### Discussion:
Further divides down into concepts such as primitiva unit cell, conventional unit cell. 
The concept of aperiodic unit is also closely related.
