also raised the issue of different dimensionality crystals, quasicrystals and so on.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal: information as above, as well as history of the term,
some discussion of various types of crystal including quasicrystals and crystal defects.

### Comments

The vast majority of crystal structures are formed of arrangements of atoms that are periodic in
3 dimensions (400,000 according to Wikipedia reference 20).

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
A solid substance for which measurements on a sample of that substance have 
been well-described by using the crystalline model (see #12 ). The model used
may include a number of distinct crystal models which taken together completely
describe the measurements. This concept does not include materials for which a
non-crystalline model has been included (for example, an amorphous component)
in order to describe the measurements.  This concept does include materials
for which the models used include other parameters not related to the atomic
structure of the material, for example powder diffraction modelling often
involves modelling of the instrumental contribution to the measurements.
### Preferred label
"crystalline material"
### Alternate labels
 "crystal", "three-dimensional crystal", "periodic crystal", "powder"
### Discussion
A material can only be known to be crystalline after measurements have been
taken on it. For example, cut glass may appear the same as a naturally-occuring
crystal, but is not crystalline. The canonical measurement technique is to illuminate
a sample of the material with beams of electrons, X-rays, or neutrons, and if
intensity is detected in specific directions the material is considered crystalline.
A material may be modelled as an aggregate of multiple crystalline materials, for
example if it is a composite, twinned or a mixture of powders.
