also raised the issue of different dimensionality crystals, quasicrystals and so on.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal: information as above, as well as history of the term,
some discussion of various types of crystal including quasicrystals and crystal defects.

### Comments

The vast majority of crystal structures are formed of arrangements of atoms that are periodic in
3 dimensions (400,000 according to Wikipedia reference 20).

### Concept elucidation
A solid substance consisting of many repeated, non-overlapping volume units, called "unit cells".

### Discussion
A material can only be known to be crystalline after measurements have been
taken on it. For example, cut glass may appear the same as a naturally-occuring
crystal, but is not crystalline. The canonical measurement technique is to illuminate
a sample of the material with beams of electrons, X-rays, or neutrons, and if
intensity is detected in specific directions the material is considered crystalline.
In order for this concept to be useful, other parts of EMMO need to state when
a particular object can be interpreted as being a single crystal.

In the EMMO approach, a real object is considered to be an ideal crystal if
data derived from a crystallographic model of an ideal crystal is interpreted
as applying to that object. If diffraction peaks are observed
from a material, that would also be a basis for considering that a material is
crystalline, but it may have a more complex structure, such as being twinned
or composite. A separate concept should be provided for such complex cases.
