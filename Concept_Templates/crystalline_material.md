also raised the issue of different dimensionality crystals, quasicrystals and so on.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal: information as above, as well as history of the term,
some discussion of various types of crystal including quasicrystals and crystal defects.

### Comments

The vast majority of crystal structures are formed of arrangements of atoms that are periodic in
3 dimensions (400,000 according to Wikipedia reference 20).

## General Concept Info

### IRI: TBA
### OWL type: TBA
### Concept elucidation
A solid, some parts of which form ideal crystals. These crystals may not be of
the same substance, or if they are of the same substance may be "twins". 
The entire solid may consist entirely of one or more crystals.
### Preferred label
"crystalline material"
### Alternate labels
 "crystal", "three-dimensional crystal", "periodic crystal"
### Discussion
A material can only be known to be crystalline after measurements have been
taken on it. For example, cut glass may appear the same as a naturally-occuring
crystal, but is not crystalline. The canonical measurement technique is to illuminate
a sample of the material with beams of electrons, X-rays, or neutrons, and if
intensity is detected in specific directions the material is considered crystalline.
In order for this concept to be useful, other parts of EMMO need to state when
a particular object can be interpreted as having crystalline components.

In the EMMO approach, a real object is considered to be crystalline if
data derived from crystallographic modelling of data from that substance is interpreted
as applying to that object. If diffraction peaks are observed
from a material, that would also be a basis for considering that a material is
crystalline. A separate concept should be provided for such complex cases.
